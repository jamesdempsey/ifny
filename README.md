# IFNY

(indie film new york)

A calendar-ish app listing showtimes and information for independent films playing in NYC.

A venture into the paper-cutting-edge of [Rails 4.0](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/2/25/Rails-4-0-beta1/) and [Ruby 2.0.0](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/).

An exercise in back-end scraping with [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/).

An excursion in [Isotope.js](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/).

And some other sweet gems.
